Server
======
This project is server agnostic and can be hosted on any web server that can serve up static html pages. However, for 
convenience, I have included a Node server. I have detailed what I did to the server to get it to work for me and how 
you can start the server up yourself.

Node Server
-----------
My Node server configuration and code can be found under [/scripts/webserver.js](https://github.com/decoy31/ImpressionCards/blob/master/scripts/web-server.js)
